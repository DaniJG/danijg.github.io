Example application that shows how to integrate a Blazor server-side application with ML.NET
- Users can upload images using the Blazor application, which are classified into one of 1000 labels using the ML.NET model.
- The ML.NET model simply loads a pre-trained TensorFlow Google's inception model.

I wrote [an article](https://www.dotnetcurry.com/author/daniel-jimenez-garcia) in the DotNetCurry magazine explaining the integration between Blazor and ML.NET.
