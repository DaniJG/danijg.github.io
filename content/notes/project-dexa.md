A CLI tool that allows developers and teams to capture their preferred tech stacks as a project template and a set of code generators.

Each of these stacks is captured as a git repository. Create them in a publicly available service such as Github to encourage usage and sharing across the wider community. But you are also free to use dexa with private repositories.
