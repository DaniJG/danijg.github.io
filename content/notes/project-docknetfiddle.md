DockNetFiddle is a simple site where users can enter minimum but complete .Net Core applications (providing the contents for the files program.cs and project.json ) which will be then executed inside a docker container. The results of the program execution will be send back and displayed to the users. In the end is a very simple version of the real [].NetFiddle site](https://dotnetfiddle.net/).

The code was discussed during an article published in [DotNetCurry](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/windows-azure/1339/docknetfiddle-using-docker-dotnet-core).
