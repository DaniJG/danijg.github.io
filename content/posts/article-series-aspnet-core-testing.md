This series of 3 articles describes in detail how to approach the main testing leves for an ASP.NET Core project.

Following the idea of the testing pyramid, the articles cover unit, integration and E2E Test. The [Blog Playground](/notes/project-blog-playground/) project is used as the test subject through these articles.

You can read the articles in the DotNetCurry magazine:

- [Integration Testing for ASP.NET Core Applications](https://www.dotnetcurry.com/aspnet-core/1420/integration-testing-aspnet-core)
