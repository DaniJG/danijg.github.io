chosen template

hidden frontmatter

graphql and node server

how do I overwrite the styles, lack of normal css classes makes it hard

how do I overwrite a component from the theme I am using? For example, I found that links defined in frontmatter were broken because the theme components are using normalize-url and dropping the `www.` from the URLs. Now what is the path to override that specific component? Supported by shadowing: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/
